## Hamming Codes

This project is an interactive visualization of [Hamming Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code), showcasing their implementation and explaining how they work to detect errors in sequences of binary data. This was largely inspired by a 2-part
series by the YouTube creator [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown), who explained this better than I ever could. I made this project entirely with vanilla HTML/JS/CSS as a way to test my baseline web development skills.
